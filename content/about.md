![about me](/img/about.me.jpg)

Hello. My name is Simon Désaulniers. I am a software developper from Québec. My
first language is [French][] and my second is English. In this blog, I may talk
about anything I want. I like programming and new technologies. I am a former
gamer and now more of a casual one. I like new ideas intending to bring power to
the people like [free][], distributed and secured software.

Although this blog may mostly be about technologies and software, which I
discuss in English for the sake of sharing with the highest number, I do tend to
speak about matters concerning my surroundings and this is something I discuss
in french ![](/img/quebec.gif). So you'll be seeing both languages on the blog
version.

Since 2016, I've been working on a distributed software called
[OpenDHT](http://opendht.net). This has helped me discover alot, so I'll be
posting a bit about this and other related subjects.

I'm also beginning a master's degree at [Université du Québec à Montréal][] in
computer science. I may share some thoughts about this too.

If someone cares about this, I've been using the GNU/Linux distribution
[Archlinux][] exclusively since 2013. Like I said above, free software is a
subject I like to discuss a lot, so you'll be seeing me talk about this I guess.

Hope you find my blog interesting !

Cheers.
