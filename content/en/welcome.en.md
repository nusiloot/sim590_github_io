# So, this is how it begins

I've been looking for a way to share thoughts about projects I had in mind,
communicating how I've lived some experiences, or simply write down about
anything. I first thought about [wordpress][] since I've already used it, but I
soon realised it wasn't fit for what I wanted. I didn't want to spend too much
time thinking about how I should deploy or update my blog. I just wanted a quick
and simple way to write a blog.

## Hugo

I first saw [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and I saw how easy it was to setup
and maintain. I thought: "This is just the thing I wanted!" But then, I found
**Hugo**. Like jekyll, Hugo is a static site generator where you write your
pages like the following:

except that jekyll is written in ruby while Hugo is written in [Go][]. That's
what bought me after all since it had all the features jekyll could offer me,
plus I couldn't worry about time efficiency when generating my site between two
consecutive writes.

### Project tree

The typical project tree looks something like this:

    ├── archetypes
    ├── config.toml
    ├── content
    │   └── post            // your posts
    ├── data
    ├── layouts
    │   └── partials
    ├── static              // your static files
    │   ├── css
    │   ├── img
    │   └── js
    └── themes
        └── imperfect       // this is the theme I chose

All of the html, css and javascript final files that the final website is
composed of are going to be generated by the Hugo engine.

### Config

You have to configure your `config.toml` file for letting Hugo generate your
website. Here's my config file so far:

```toml
baseurl = "http://sim590.github.io"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "Simon Désaulniers"
theme = "imperfect"
preserveTaxonomyNames = true
paginate = 3
disqusShortname = "shortname"
googleAnalytics = ""

[params]
    # Sets the meta tag description, usually reserved for the main page
    description          = "HTML5 UP theme, Future Imperfect with some extra goodies, ported by Julio Pescador. Powered by Hugo"
    # This will appear on the top left of the navigation bar
    navbarTitle          = "Simon Désaulniers"
    # Social media buttons that appear on the sidebar
    socialAppearAtTop    = true
    socialAppearAtBottom = true
    # set this to the section name if section is not post
    #viewMorePostLink     = "/blog/"

# Optional Params
    categoriesByCount    = true
    includeReadingTime   = true
    # The set of favicons used are based on the write-up from this link:

    # Please see the favicon partial template for more information
    loadFavicon          = false
    faviconVersion       = ""

    # Load custom CSS or JavaScript files. This replaces the deprecated params
    # minifiedFilesCSS and minifiedFilesJS. The variable is an array so that you
    # can load multiple files if necessary. You can also load the standard theme
    # files by adding the value, "default".
    # customCSS            = ["default", "/path/to/file"]

    customCSS            = ["/css/main.min.css"]
    customJS             = ["/js/main.min.js"]

[params.intro]

    imperfect = true

# Adjust the amount of recent posts on the sidebar.
# This is optional. The default value 5 will be used
#[params.postAmount]
#    sidebar = 2

# Set up your menu items in the navigation bar
# You can use identifier to prepend a font awesome icon to your text
[[menu.main]]
