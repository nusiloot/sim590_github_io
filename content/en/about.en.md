![about me](/images/about.me.jpg)

My name is Simon DÃ©saulniers. I am a person who works in my daily life in math
and computer science. I am interested in several subjects such as:

* algorithmics;
* computer languages;
* IT security and cryptography;
* computer software and tools;
* distributed systems;
* free and privacy-friendly software;
* algebra;
* etc.

My interests go beyond computer science and math, of course. I particularly like
languages, culture, music, politics and video games.

## The content of my website

On this website, I expose different concepts, notions or practices on different
subjects. I like to share my discoveries, problem solving and analyzes. I hope
to allow many to get out of this something useful or at least interesting. I am
a user of free software and in particular GNU/Linux since 2012. It is therefore
possible that subjects related to this are exploited.
