## Week 10 & 11

During these two weeks, I've worked hard on paginating values on the DHT.

### Value pagination

As explained on my post on data persistence, we've had network traffic issues.
The solution we have found for this is to use the [queries][] (see also
[this](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht/issues/43)) to filter data on
the remote peer we're communicating with. The queries let us select fields of a
value instead of fetching whole values. This way, we can fetch values with
unique ids. The **pagination** is the process of first selecting all value ids
for a given hash, then making a separate "get" request packet for each of the
values.

This feature makes the DHT more friendly with UDP. In fact, UDP packets can be
dropped when of size greater than the UDP [MTU][]. Paginating values will help
this as all UDP packets will now contain only one value.

## Week 12

I've been working on making the "put" request lighter, again using queries. This
is a key feature which will make it possible to enable [data persistence][]. In
fact, it enables us to send values to a peer only if it doesn't already have the
value we're announcing. This will substantially reduce the overall traffic. This
feature is still being tested. The last thing I have to do is to demonstrate the
reduction of network traffic.
